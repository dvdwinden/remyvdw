# Remy van der Winden
## Motion Designer

Hi! I'm Remy, a Motion Designer from the Netherlands.

Twelve years ago, I started out as a Graphic Designer. I have experience designing brand identities, illustrations, icons, and websites. Now, I lead the Motion department at a design studio called [Noeste IJver](http://noesteijver.nl/ "Noeste IJver").

As part of a small design team I've experienced every aspect of the design process, and created work for a variety of clients—many of them socially engaged.

When at home, I watch, read, listen to and play many things. Currently I'm very much living up to my 30s by taking pictures of birds and baking my own bread.
