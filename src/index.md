# Remy van der Winden

Hi! I'm Remy, a Motion Designer from the Netherlands.

I started out as a Graphic Designer twelve years ago, before committing to Motion Design later on.

I’m experienced in creating brand identities, illustrations, icons, and websites, but also started and lead the Motion department at my current employer.

As part of a small design team I've experienced every aspect of the design process, and produced work for a variety of clients. Mainly focussed on clients that are in some way socially involved.

When at home, I watch, read, listen to and play many things. Currently very much living up to my 30’s era by taking pictures of birds and baking my own bread.
