# Remy van der Winden
## Motion Designer

Hi! I'm Remy, a Motion Designer from the Netherlands.

Twelve years ago, I started out as a Graphic Designer. My experience ranges from designing brand identities and illustrations, to icons and websites. Currently I lead the Motion Design department at a Dutch design studio called [**Noeste IJver**](http://noesteijver.nl/ "Noeste IJver").

As part of a small design team I've experienced every aspect of the design process, and created work for a variety of clients—many of them socially engaged.

Now and then I'm available for a freelance project. Recently, I've contributed motion design work for **Google Meet** and **Google Chat**, collaborating with <a href="http://timokuilder.com?ref=remyvdw.nl" title="Timo Kuilder" rel="external" target="_blank">Timo Kuilder</a>.

I've often worked with design studio [Bakken & Bæck](http://bakkenbaeck.com?ref=remyvdw.nl "Bakken & Bæck"), delivering motion design for their own case studies, and companies like [**Carbo Culture**](https://carboculture.com/?ref=remyvdw.nl "Carbo Culture"), [**Ramp**](https://ramp.com/?ref=remyvdw.nl "Ramp"), and **Spring**.

When at home, I watch, read, listen to and play many things. Currently I'm very much living up to my 30s by taking pictures of birds and baking my own bread. And, I like to keep chipping away at my personal illustration and motion design work, too.
